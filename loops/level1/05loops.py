# 5️⃣ Count how many numbers are present in this list:
# [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

lst = [2,4,6,8,10]
count = 0
for i in lst:
    count = count + 1

print("the total number of list is => ",count)

#  why i put my print value outside the loop 

#  bcz if i put this insid the loop they will print again and again
