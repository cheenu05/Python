## Interview mode ON — 60-second OOP explanation (REAL, PRACTICAL, NO RATTA)


## 🎤 “Explain OOP in 60 seconds” – Answer

• Object-Oriented Programming is a way to design software by modeling real-world entities using classes and objects.

• It is based on four core principles:

• Encapsulation means protecting internal data and allowing controlled access through methods, so sensitive data isn’t directly modified.

• Inheritance allows a class to reuse and extend another class’s behavior, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

• Polymorphism lets the same method behave differently based on the object calling it, enabling flexible and scalable code.

• Abstraction defines mandatory behavior using interfaces or abstract classes, ensuring consistency while hiding implementation details.

• Together, these principles help build secure, reusable, and scalable systems that are easier to maintain and extend.

## “In short, OOP helps structure code the same way we structure real systems.”
